## BDA4CID 2019 
### A Workshop at 2019 IEEE International Conference on Big Data [(IEEE Big Data 2018)](http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2019)
December 9-12, 2019, Los Angeles, CA, USA

Cyber-attacks have posed real and wide-ranging threats for the information society. Detecting cyber-attacks becomes a challenge, not only because of the sophistication of attacks, but also because of the large scale and complex nature of today’s IT infrastructures.

When significant amounts of data is collected from computer systems operations and monitoring, data science and intelligent advanced analytics are necessary to correlate, learn and mine, interpret and visualize such data. To mitigate existing cyber threats, it is important that cyber-attack detection and security analysis take advantage of data science and advanced analytics. Big data provides a systemic approach, from capturing of IT operation data, through data processing and event correlation, to anomaly detection and response decision.

This Workshop will focus on the cutting-edge developments from both academia and industry, with a particular emphasis on novel techniques to capture, store and process the big-data from a wide range of sources in monitoring IT infrastructures, and in particular on the methodologies and technologies which can be applied to correlate, learn and mine, interpret and visualize the cyber security data.

This workshop is timely and interesting for researchers, academics and practitioners in big data processing and analytics, cyber security, cyber defense, security analytics, data mining and machine learning of security data, security information and event management, along with anomaly detection. The workshop is very relevant to the big data community, especially data mining, machine learning, cycler physical systems, computational intelligence, and will bring forth a lively forum on this exciting and challenging area at the conference.

The 2017 International Workshop on Big Data Analytics for Cyber Intelligence and Defense (BDA4CID 2017) at last year’s IEEE Big Data 2017 Conference at Boston, USA, was a great success and had attracted very positive responses from the authors and the audience. We believe the BDA4CID 2018 will continue and gain even greater success.

## Research Topics

The workshop only considers well-written manuscripts that describe original, unpublished, state-of-the-art research and practical work. Indicative topics for the workshop are as follows.

Cyber security analytics
* Big data analytics (e.g., text/graph/pattern mining) for cyber intelligence
* Big data analytics (e.g., text/graph/pattern mining) for cyber security
* Big data intelligence for combating advanced persistent threats (APT)
* Big data for cyber intelligence and cyber situational awareness
* Big data processing platforms for cyber security and defense
* Cyber security analytics for cloud computing
* Cyber security visualization
* Cyber threat intelligence and modeling
* Cyber defense/security operations centers
* Log management for cyber security analytics
* Machine learning / deep learning for cyber threat and security
* Next-generation Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
* Next-generation intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS)
* Real-time event correlation for cyber security analytics
* Real-time monitoring of computer and network systems
* Security incident management for cyber security analytics
* Stream mining / analytics for cyber intelligence and r security
* Vulnerability analysis and modelling

Social media analytics
* Fake news detection in social media networks
* Natural language processing for social media data analysis
* Opinion mining in social media networks
* Sentiment analysis in social media networks
* Security and privacy issues in social media networks
* Social media data mining
* Text mining / machine learning for social media data analysis
* Web bots and big data processing for social media networks

To contribute towards advances of knowledge, the workshop solicits original manuscripts from researchers and practitioners who are actively working in Big Data Analytics for Cyber Intelligence and Defense.
